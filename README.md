# RESTful_API_Tester
RESTful API Tester is a simple Android application that tests a RESTful API. In this case, the application
queries Google's Books API searching for a given book's title and author's name. The app is based on the Android Developer Fundamentals Course
found [here](https://www.gitbook.com/@google-developer-training), and has an updated layout using a ConstraintLayout with 
a modular classification of the classes involved. It also has a cleaned up code and a progress indicator.
